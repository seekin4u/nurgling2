			Haven & Hearth Client

This client is used to connect to the server for the Haven & Hearth
online game and play said game. For details regarding the game itself,
please refer to its main website at <http://www.havenandhearth.com/>.
This file exists mainly to describe various technical aspects of the
source tree.

			  Nurgling is a custom client.
Nurgling is not a fork of existing clients and is based on a pure 
standard client.

The main purpose of this client is to provide advanced logistical
capabilities when planning and building your village. The client 
allows you to automate routine tasks such as smelting ore, drying hides,
replanting fields, and more. To this end, a new entity - the Area -
has been introduced into the gameplay within this client.
You can create an unlimited number of Areas, in which you can specify
which items can be picked up, which can be stored, and how they 
can be stored.
The existing area system can be used for both automation and village
planning, which you can share with your friends.

The client also offers options to partially automate all crafting in
the game. You can set recipes, and by telling your character where 
and what ingredients to get, they will do all the work themselves.

More information about this client can be found in the client
