Bot is engaged in improving the quality of chickens and cutting their carcasses. The bot transfers chickens to coops and also collects all eggs of worse quality than the worst chicken in the best coop. You need to specify a zone with the specialisation ‘Chicken’ for chicken coops and ‘Chick Incubator’ for incubators. You also need to specify a zone with water and swill, each with a barrel, and optionally a cistern. All other ingredients are distributed by the zone system (section ‘Put’).
