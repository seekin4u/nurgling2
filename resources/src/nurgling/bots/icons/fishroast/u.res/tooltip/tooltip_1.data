Bot is roasting fish on a spit. You need to have an area with specialisation ‘fuel(block)’. At the start of the bot, select the piles of fish, which fires with spits to use and where to put the cooked fish (e.g. in the table). A candelabra with a candle is used for ignition. The bot will spin one of the spits in its free time.
