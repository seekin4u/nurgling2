#String tooltip
The bot hangs rawhides on drying frames. You need to specify an area with specialisation ‘dframe’ for dryers, and an area with specialisation ‘rawhides’ for fresh skins. The finished skins are put out by the area system (section ‘Put’). The bot does NOT USE the ‘readyhides’ specialisation - it is needed for the tannery bot.
