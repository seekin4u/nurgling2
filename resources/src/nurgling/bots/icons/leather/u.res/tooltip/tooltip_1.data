Bot tans the leather in tanning tubs. You need to specify an area with tubs with specialisation ‘ttub’. You will also need a barrel of tanning fluid, and a cistern, if you need more than one barrel for refilling. The bot uses the ‘readyhides’ specialisation area for filling tubs. The leather is unloaded using the ‘Put’ section of the area system.
