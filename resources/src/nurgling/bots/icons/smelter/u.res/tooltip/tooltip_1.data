The bot will smelt ore in automatic mode. You will need to designate an area with ore piles in the area system. To do this, you need to set the area's specialisation to 'ore'. Then you need to specify an area with 'smelter' specialisation, where ore smelters or furnaces are located. Depending on the type of smelters, you will need to specify a 'fuel' area, specifying the type of fuel in the area (coal or branches). Finally, in the area system, in the "Put" section, you must explicitly specify which bars are to be placed where. If you want the bot to smelt mercury, you need to have a bucket in hand and specify the area with the specialisation 'barrel(Quicksilver)'. A candelabra with a candle is used for ignition.
