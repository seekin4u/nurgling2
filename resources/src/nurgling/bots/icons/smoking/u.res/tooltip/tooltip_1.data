#String tooltip
The bot allows you to compose and ignite smoking sheds according to a given list of recipes. Drag and drop a semi-finished product(item) into the recipe settings window, and specify the fuel type as part of the model name of the log used. You will need to specify the ‘sheds’ specialisation area for the smoking sheds, and the 'fuel(logs)' specialisation area for the log searches. Depending on the available logs, the bot will go through the list of active recipes and fill the sheds with fuel and semi-finished products, assuming that you can fill the cabinet at least halfway. Otherwise the semi-finished products must be returned to the area system in the ‘Put’ section. The bot finds the semi-finished products in the ‘Take’ section of the area system.
